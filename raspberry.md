## Software

Operating system:

- Ubuntu 21.04, 64-bit: recommended for developers
- Raspberry Pi OS: is not recommended because (1) it is 32-bit OS where a lot of applications such as Android Studio require 64-bit OS and (2) packages available in its package repository is quite limited.

Utilities for Raspberry Pi:

- Raspberry Pi Imager: available for Mac, Windows, and Linux; allows you to install OS to an SD card
